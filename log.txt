Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\n\nYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration)\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)\n\n### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)\n"}}

Assess Scope\n\n```bash\n# Check service health\nkubectl get pods -n payments -l app=payment-service\n\n# Check recent deployments\nkubectl rollout history deployment/payment-service -n payments\n\n# Check error rates\ncurl -s \"http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[5m]))\"\n```\n````\n\n### 2. Quick Health Checks\n\n- [ ] Can you reach the service? `curl -I https://api.company.com/payments/health`\n- [ ] Database connectivity? Check connection pool metrics\n- [ ] External dependencies? Check Stripe, bank API status\n- [ ] Recent changes? Check deploy history\n\n### 3.

AudioContext Mock 失敗 (Priority: HIGH)\n\n**問題描述:**\nGameBoard 測試中的 Web Audio API mock 配置不完整，導致多個測試案例失敗。\n\n**錯誤訊息:**\n```\nTypeError: audioContext.createOscillator is not a function\n```\n\n**失敗的測試案例:**\n1. `increments moves when two cards are flipped`\n2. `starts timer on first card click`\n3. `increases score when cards match`\n4. `flips cards back if they do not match`\n5. `prevents clicking more than two cards at once`\n6. `formats time correctly`\n\n**根本原因:**\n測試檔案中的 AudioContext mock (GameBoard.test.js:7-20) 創建了一個靜態物件，但每次 `playSound()` 被調用時，會創建新的 AudioContext 實例。Mock 應該返回一個建構函數，而非靜態物件。\n\n**影響範圍:**\n- 所有涉及卡片點擊的測試\n- 遊戲流程測試\n- 計時器測試\n\n**建議修復方案:**\n\n```javascript\n// 在 setupTests.js 或 GameBoard.test.js 頂部\nglobal.AudioContext = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {\n  const mockOscillator = {\n    connect: jest.fn(),\n    disconnect: jest.fn(),\n    frequency: { value: 0 },\n    type: 'sine',\n    start: jest.fn(),\n    stop: jest.fn(),\n  };\n\n  const mockGainNode = {\n    connect: jest.fn(),\n    disconnect: jest.fn(),\n    gain: {\n      value: 0,\n      setValueAtTime: jest.fn(),\n      exponentialRampToValueAtTime: jest.fn(),\n    },\n  };\n\n  return {\n    createOscillator: jest.fn(() => mockOscillator),\n    createGain: jest.fn(() => mockGainNode),\n    destination: {},\n    currentTime: 0,\n    close: jest.fn(),\n    resume: jest.fn(),\n  };\n});\n\nglobal.webkitAudioContext = global.AudioContext;\n```\n\n**預期結果:**\n修復後，所有 6 個失敗的測試應該通過。\n\n---\n\n### 🟡 次要問題\n\n#### 2. React Act Warning (Priority: MEDIUM)\n\n**問題描述:**\n在測試中使用 fake timers 時，React 狀態更新沒有被正確包裝在 `act(...)` 中。\n\n**警告訊息:**\n```\nWarning: An update to GameBoard inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)\n```\n\n**影響的測試:**\n- `starts timer on first card click`\n- `flips cards back if they do not match`\n\n**建議修復:**\n\n```javascript\nimport { act } from '@testing-library/react';\n\ntest('starts timer on first card click', async () => {\n  const { container } = render(<GameBoard />);\n  const cards = container.querySelectorAll('.card');\n\n  expect(screen.getByText('0:00')).toBeInTheDocument();\n\n  fireEvent.click(cards[0]);\n\n  // 使用 act 包裝 timer advancement\n  await act(async () => {\n    jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);\n  });\n\n  expect(screen.getByText('0:01')).toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 測試通過的功能\n\n### Card 組件 (100% 覆蓋率) ✨\n\n所有測試全部通過，覆蓋率達到 100%：\n\n- ✅ 未翻開狀態顯示問號\n- ✅ 翻開狀態顯示表情符號\n- ✅ 點擊事件正確觸發\n- ✅ 已翻開卡片無法再次點擊\n- ✅ 已配對卡片無法再次點擊\n- ✅ CSS 類別正確應用 (flipped, matched)\n- ✅ 卡片 DOM 結構完整 (card-inner, card-front, card-back)\n\n**測試品質評估:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 優秀\n\n---\n\n### App 組件 (100% 覆蓋率) ✨\n\n所有基本渲染測試通過：\n\n- ✅ App 組件成功渲染\n- ✅ GameBoard 組件成功載入\n- ✅ 遊戲統計資訊顯示 (時間、移動次數、得分)\n- ✅ 設定切換按鈕顯示\n- ✅ 重新開始按鈕顯示\n- ✅ 卡片陣列正確渲染\n\n**測試品質評估:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 良好\n\n---\n\n### GameBoard 組件 (部分通過)\n\n**通過的測試 (10/16):**\n\n#### UI 渲染測試 ✅\n- ✅ 遊戲標題渲染\n- ✅ 初始遊戲統計顯示\n- ✅ 設定切換按鈕渲染\n- ✅ 設定面板顯示/隱藏\n- ✅ 所有難度按鈕存在\n- ✅ 所有主題按鈕存在\n\n#### 設定功能測試 ✅\n- ✅ 難度切換功能 (簡單 16 卡 → 中等 20 卡)\n- ✅ 主題切換功能 (active 類別正確應用)\n- ✅ 音效切換功能 (開啟 🔊 ↔ 關閉 🔇)\n\n#### 遊戲控制測試 ✅\n- ✅ 重新開始按鈕功能\n- ✅ 格線佈局正確 (簡單難度 = 4 欄)\n- ✅ 從 localStorage 載入最佳成績\n\n**失敗的測試 (6/16):**\n- ❌ 移動次數增加 (AudioContext 問題)\n- ❌ 計時器啟動 (AudioContext 問題)\n- ❌ 配對成功得分 (AudioContext 問題)\n- ❌ 不匹配卡片翻回 (AudioContext 問題)\n- ❌ 防止同時點擊超過兩張卡 (AudioContext 問題)\n- ❌ 時間格式化 (AudioContext 問題)\n\n**測試品質評估:** ⭐⭐⭐ 尚可\n\n---\n\n## 📈 程式碼覆蓋率分析\n\n### GameBoard.js 未覆蓋的程式碼\n\n#### 未測試的行數:\n- **61-64:** 難度配置物件\n- **97-122:** 音效播放系統 (flip, match, victory)\n- **127-136:** 最佳成績保存邏輯\n- **156-161:** 卡片配對檢查邏輯\n- **166-175:** 勝利條件判定和處理\n\n#### 覆蓋率缺口分析:\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ 未測試: 音效系統 (playSound 函數)\ncase 'flip':\n  oscillator.frequency.value = 400;\n  // ...\n\ncase 'match':\n  oscillator.frequency.value = 600;\n  // ...\n\ncase 'victory':\n  oscillator.frequency.value = 800;\n  // ...\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ 未測試: 最佳成績保存\nconst saveBestScore = useCallback(() => {\n  const key = `${difficulty}-${theme}`;\n  const currentBestScore = bestScores[key];\n\n  if (!currentBestScore || time < currentBestScore.time) {\n    // 保存邏輯...\n  }\n}, [/* ... */]);\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ 未測試: 配對檢查邏輯\nconst firstCard = flippedCards[0];\nconst secondCard = flippedCards[1];\n\nif (firstCard.emoji === secondCard.emoji) {\n  // 配對成功邏輯...\n  setMatchedCards(prev => [...prev, firstCard.id, secondCard.id]);\n  setScore(prev => prev + 10);\n  playSound('match');\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ 未測試: 勝利判定\nif (matchedCards.length === cards.length) {\n  setGameWon(true);\n  setIsTimerRunning(false);\n  playSound('victory');\n  saveBestScore();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 建議新增的測試案例\n\n### 高優先級 (應立即新增)\n\n#### GameBoard 遊戲邏輯測試\n\n1. **配對成功測試**\n```javascript\ntest('shows matched animation and increases score when cards match', async () => {\n  // 測試配對成功時:\n  // - 分數增加 10 分\n  // - 卡片保持翻開\n  //
